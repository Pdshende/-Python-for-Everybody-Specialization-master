## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).

## How the Specialization Works
# Take Courses
A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.

# Hands-on Project
Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.

## Programming Assignments

- Course 1: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

   - [Week 2 - PA 1 - Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/Pdshende/Deep-learning-offered-by-deeplearning.ai/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Assignment/Logistic%20Regression%20with%20a%20Neural%20Network%20mindset.ipynb)
   
## Quiz Solutions

There are concerns that some people may use the content here to quickly ace the course so I'll no longer update any quiz solution.

- Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

  - [Week 1 - Quiz 1 - Introduction to deep learning](https://github.com/Pdshende/Deep-learning-offered-by-deeplearning.ai/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Quizs/Week%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20deep%20learning.md)
